My name is Francesco Granato.
I am a particle physicist with a penchant for coding.
I developed Monte Carlo simulations using dedicated software for many dark matter search experiments.
I created a data structure to accomodate the output for the HUNTER experiment, and developed the analysis software to examine said data.
